# Observation Operator

  This directory is the initiation of a set of observation operators for each new
  data 'class'. I am assuming that it will be most convenient and efficient to 
  process all similar data type (e.g. profiles, including temperature and salinity
  from Argo, XBTs, CTDs, etc.) in its own observation operator program.

  Ultimately, this should allow distributed work effort on each new data type,
  possibily even allowing the satellite data providers to compute their own
  observation operators for rapid inclusion into the operational ocean data
  assimilation system.
