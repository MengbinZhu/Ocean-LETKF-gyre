These files are modified from 3DVar-GODAS to pre-process the obs data for LETKF (i.e. to add error estimates based on vertical temperature gradient)



-----
Commented out lines in "extDysP4nc.c" to allow for differently formatted observation filenames:
/scratch2/portfolios/NCEPDEV/climate/noscrub/David.Behringer/ARCS/DAILYnc
The profiles have a different naming format:
(It's expecting something like 2006tmpO.tar and 2006salM.tar, but getting 2006tmp.tar and 2006sal.tar) 


Need the archive "hydro.a":

Presumably, the only difference between the 'synthetic' and 'realobs' (obsa) versions are the computation of potential temperature,
and the computation of the standard error (deviation). The former is sampled directly from the model in the synthetic case,
and the latter is computed in advance and appended to the netcdf file in the synthetic case. So, a single script could be
used for both cases given appropriate options. For now, for safety, they are done in separate files.
