# Directories:
The xml/ scripts control the cycling of the data assimilation cycle  

The scripts/ directory contains the shell scripts that are called to execute:  
    model_prep.ksh  
    model.ksh  
    letkf_prep.ksh  
    letkf.ksh  

# Setting up to run:  
On a disk with large memory storage:  
Create an output directory, e.g. "/lustre/uid/OUTPUT/tmp_XYZ"  
Link the output directory to a local tmp directory, e.g. "ln -fs /lustre/uid/OUTPUT/tmp_XYZ tmp"  
Create a log directory, e.g. "/lustre/uid/OUTPUT/tmp_XYZ/log"  
Line the log directory to a local log directory, e.g. "ln -fs /lustre/uid/OUTPUT/tmp_XYZ/log log"  
Put an initial experiment directory in tmp/  
  e.g. "cp -rl /lustre/uid/OUTPUT/tmp_ABC/1990122700 tmp/"  
  note: it must contain all model RESTART directories (for each ensemble member) and letkf and/or hybrid analyses  
Also put the static files in the tmp directory  
  e.g. "cp -rl /lustre/uid/OUPUT/tmp_ABC/INIT/INPUT tmp/INIT/INPUT"  
Install rocoto if not already installed.  
Update the submit_job file with the correct directory and file names  
Update the xml script with the local drectories  
Run ./submit_job  
update the crontab with the calling line from submit_job, and the desired time interval: "crontab -e"
