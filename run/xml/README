I realized that sending many jobs through the workflow manager (rocoto) caused a lot of wait time. By sending more
intensive jobs, but fewer of them, the total wallclock time seems to be improved. The 'compact' versions of the scripts
are identical functionally but have this organization.

The 'hybrid' version is the current main script.

The 'only' suffix implies that only that part of the code is run, and is meant for a single timestep test run.


godas_control is applied to the LETKF/HYBRID forecast

godas_solo is an independent run of godas for comparison
